# Welcome to TULIP 2.0

>"Everything will be alright as long as you have your -ing potato." - Mr. Tulip, to Mr. Pin, _The Truth_, by Terry Pratchett

>"See a pin and pick it up, and all day long youâ€™ll have a pin!" - Stanley Howler, _Going Postal_, by Terry Pratchett

## A full pin mod for the AB motor mounts, XY gantry joints and front idler tensioners for the Voron v0.2

 - AB motors mounted solidly to the frame, meaning no more shunting them back and forth with a bulky tensioning nut.
 - Tension is now applied through an M3 screw in the front idlers, and ALL bearing stacks run on pins rather than screws.
 - Both MGN7H (stock) and MGN9C X rails are supported, WITH NO TRAVEL LOSS.
 - Pins are standard 3mm off-the-shelf sizing, for those unable to cut their own
 - LazyCam Support
 - Nema 17 AB Motor Mount Beta
 - Fysetc X light gantry compatibility (use standard XY joints)
 - Mamabot.io X light gantry support
 - Nema 14 - 35mm Shaft Motor Mount Beta
 - Live Idler XY joints + Tension Idlers
