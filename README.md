A full pin mod for the AB motor mounts, XY gantry joints and front idler tensioners for the Voron v0.2

 - AB motors mounted solidly to the frame, meaning no more shunting them back and forth with a bulky tensioning nut.
 - Tension is now applied through an M3 screw in the front idlers, and all bearing stacks run on pins rather than screws.
 - MGN7H (stock) and MGN9C X rails are supported, with no travel loss.
 - Pins are standard M3 off-the-shelf sizing, for those unable to cut their own
 - MGN9H BETA

> **CHANGE LOG**

16/09/24

CAD v28 release

Both Standard and LazyCAM static bodies have has the access hole size changed (for the front fixing into the extrusion) so that longer screws can be used and dropped in from the top.

A NEW motor "Pully Tool" has been made to measure from the motor tops rather than from the top of the shaft

BOM has been updated to show "Washers / Shims" for the bearing stacks

XY_Upper_Joint Fixings changed from M3x6mm to M3x8mm on CAD

PIN GUIDE has been added to help users get the best from TULIP

MGN9H BETA (yes H) has been added for those wanting to use this type of rail setup. All printed parts needed are in the STL's frolder MGN9H.
> **Note - A 160mm Rail is required for full travel**

----

04/09/24

CAD v27 release

Amended Pin hole depth on parts

- Top_Mount_A_MGN9C_x1
- Top_Mount_B_MGN9C_x1

Motor "Pully Tool" has now been added to help get them in the right place

Picture of the tool has been added to the PICS folder

STL's have been updated for the latest change for the parts affected

----

24/08/24

CAD v26 release

CAD names have been updated to be consistant with the STL names and the [a] for accent colour marking has also been added. Corrected a mistake where the Voron Logo was mirrored on Mid_Mount_A_x1.

STL's Updated to latest Names denoting the [a] for accent colours. corrected Mid_Mount_A_x1 STL

----

08/08/24

CAD v25 release

Idler tensioners static body had printability update to make B side easier to print (less chance to warp off the bed)

tensioner upers had changes to work with new static bodies

Tensioner lowers captive nut minor geometry changes - better pre-engagement with tension screw - reduced hole size after captive nut to act as tension screw "nylock"

LazyCam static bodies added for those wishing to use the LazyCam system (type C)

----

10/07/24

CAD v24 release

Idler tensioners static body is now one piece and printed on its side

Idler tensioners lock screw is now static with slot in tensioner parts

XY joints had some holes resized and some minor corrections

Spacers - new fillet chamfer design (fillamfer)

AB Motor mounts plates and mid parts have locating tabs to secure each other together for more secure umbilical plate attachment

Tools added - Bearing insert tool & Drill jig for access to tensioner locking screw
