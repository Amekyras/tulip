The Nema 17 Motor Mounts at the moment are experiemental and in Beta Test phase

please note that you will need a minimum of a 24mm shaft for the double shear to work, so if your intending to use old nema 17 motors you have measure up the shaft length to make sure it is suitable.

the AB Motor plate, Rear Cover and Top Hat Hinges are all WORK IN PROGRESS and these will be added in due time.

If you have any ideas / requirements to the AB Motor Plate i would be happy to make something up (ie. CanBus / Umbilical)

Also please note that this setup can only be used with MGN7H rails currently, MGN9 compatability will be added in time.
