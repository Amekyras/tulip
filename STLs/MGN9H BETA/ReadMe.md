THIS MOD ALLOWS THE USE OF AN MGN9H RAIL FOR THE X AXIS

WITH THE LARGER AND WIDER CART IT SHOULLD ADD SOME EXTRA PERFORMANCE TO YOUR V0

To use the MGN9H setup you will need a 160mm rail for full X travel

THIS IS A BETA TEST AND MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN USE A CHEAPER RAIL WITH LESS PRELOAD AND STILL GET GOOD PERFORMANCE
