# PRINTING GUIDE

All parts print with standard VORON settings. 
You may need to gently ream out holes with a 3mm drill bit after printing - don't go wild, be gentle!

## PART SELECTION
You need to print:
- One set of AB mounts
  - S22 for standard 22mm shaft motors
  - S35 for 35mm shaft motors like the LDO 2A NEMA14s
  - All MGN9C-marked motor mounts also work for MGN7H
- One set of XY joints
- One set of front idlers
  - Additional LazyCam parts may need to be downloaded from the author's repo 
- Six hexagonal spacers (but print twelve because you *will* lose them)
- If needed, pin cutting jigs, pulley alignment jigs, and frame drilling jigs can be found in Tools.


## EXPERIMENTAL PARTS
- Various experimental parts can be found in the Experimental folder, but these parts may not be up-to-date with the latest Tulip revisions - use with care!
- If you are using experimental parts, following along with the CAD is *highly* recommended, even more so than with standard parts.
